<h2>Process</h2>

The conception of the idea for the website came from searching through countless API's to use for the project and stumbling upon the NASA API. Brainstorming for the idea came with wanting to present the user with different ways to research a certain subject, that being NASA, and having most of the information wanted all on one accessible site that flows and is easy to use. The website is titled NASA NOW with the intention of informing the incoming user of present NASA information. 

<h2>Topics</h2>

We include numerous up to date information such as:

* Astronomy Photo of the Day
* Latest Pictures from the Curiosity Rover on Mars
* Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera
* Database of Notifications Knowledge Information
* Nasa on YouTube

<h2>Components</h2>

Numerous techniques were used in the process of making NASA NOW. We started off with the creation of the HTML skeleton and coming up with ways on how the user can interact and how they can interact with the content present throughout the page. The next step was the order in which the user would consume the knowledge being presented to them. After creating much of the HTML foundation we split into groups and half started on producing the JavaScript and the use of the API's within the file and the other half started creating the CSS file and more HTML formatting. After much of the site was functional we mostly all worked together for some further clean ups of the HTML and CSS with the group all collaborating for what we all think is best and where it would fit in best.

<h2>Tools</h2>

* Animate
* Bootstrap
* CSS
* Google Fonts
* HTML
* JavaScript
* Moment

<h2>Issues faced</h2>

In the time collaborating on this site, we as a group came across a few issues that hindered our progress. Small problems with the API's not implementing correctly or when the navbar would stop randomly working. Other than that, as a group we communicated on what we all wanted for this and compromised so that most of our needs were met in order to create something so collaborative like this.
